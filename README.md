# SIFT-CNN-hybrid
This project implements the code to create a hybrid model which combines a basic CNN with handcrafted SIFT features. The CNN is based on the ALL-CNN-A network from https://github.com/wtsyang/dl-reproducibility-project/blob/master/Report.ipynb. The dataset used is CIFAR-10. The model can tested by simply running main.py. 
The SIFT features are created using OpenCV's Dense SIFT feature generator, which creates a set amount of features which are then flattened and combined with the flattened feature maps created by the CNN. The combined feature vectore is then fed to a series of fully connected layers which output the result. By default the training batch size is 256, the learning rate 0.05 the network is trained for 350 epochs. Preprocessing includes random horizontal flipping, random cropping and normalization.
