# SIFT-CNN-hybrid
In this project implements the code to create a hybrid model which combines a basic CNN with handcrafted SIFT features. The CNN is based on the ALL-CNN-A network from https://github.com/wtsyang/dl-reproducibility-project/blob/master/Report.ipynb. The dataset used is CIFAR-10. The model can tested by simply running main.py.
